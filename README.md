# SumMetricSystem
A metric logging and reporting service that sums metrics by time window for the most recent hour.

##Â Specification

This service has two endpoints:
- An endpoint to add metric values:
```
Request:
POST /metric/{key}
{
"value": 30
}

Response: (200)
{}
```
- Another one to sum the metric values in the last 60 minutes:
```
Request:
GET /metric/{key}/sum

Response:
{
  "value": 400
}
```

Some important things:
- Every value added must to be deleted after 60 minutes.
- Every value added must to be rounded to the nearest integer.
- No database/store system is needed, a basic datastructure or file is enough.

## Development

This service was developed using node 12.16.x.
You need `node` and `npm` to make it work.

It was coded using Babel, to support modules and some features of ES6/7 at development time. It has a pretty basic configuration, though. The code can be found at `./src` directory.

Also, to make easier the configuration of some variables, the application relays on dotEnv.

### Start the service

To start the service in order to test it functionally, you just need to run the command: `npm run start:dev`; and that's it, this command will run the linter, transpile the code, and configure the environment as is needed for development.

Once the server is ready to listen, you can use your favorite REST client to hit the URLs:
```
# To add a metric value
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ishallpass' \
  -d '{"value": 123}' \
  -v \ # This flag is completely optional, but you know, it helps some times.
  'http://localhost:3000/metric/visitors'
```

```
# To check the sum of values of a specific metric
curl \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ishallpass' \
  -v \ # This flag is completely optional, but you know, it helps some times.
  'http://localhost:3000/metric/visitors/sum'
```

### Application structure

The application has a pretty simple structure:
- `./src/.eslintrc.json`: Some basic configurations to have some codestyling.
- `./src/auth.js`: A simple authorization-simulator middleware.
- `./src/babel.config.json`: The babel configuration.
- `./src/index.js`: Is the controller file, this handle the http requests.
- `./src/model.js`: It's a representation of a "data store", and the entity that is "persisted" (A.K.A. the metric).
- `./src/service.js`: Here you can find the business logic.


## Deployment

The deployment process is pretty simple thanks to AWS CodePipeline. Currently is set to listen on commits/push signals on master branch. So, every push signal into master branch will result as a build on AWS CodePipeline that will impact the Elastic BeanStack environment.
